	ArrayList in Java
	
	Declaration:
	public class ArrayList<E> extends AbstractList<E> 
	        implements List<E>, Cloneable, Serializable, RandomAccess
	
	Overview:
	- It is an implementation class of the List interface, available from JDK 1.2.
	- Stores elements based on index positions.
	- Can accept duplicate, null, homogeneous, and heterogeneous elements.
	- Uses a dynamic array data structure, meaning it can grow dynamically.
	- The default capacity is 10; the next capacity is 16 (approximately 60% increase).
	
	Capacity Growth Formula:
	new capacity = (current capacity * 3) / 2 + 1
	Example: (10 * 3) / 2 + 1 = 16
	
	Synchronization:
	- Methods are not synchronized, so performance-wise, it is faster than Vector.
	- Not thread-safe, hence best used where thread safety is not required.
	
	Implemented Interfaces:
	- List
	- Cloneable
	- Serializable
	- RandomAccess
	
	Iterator Type:
	- Uses a fail-fast iterator (throws ConcurrentModificationException if modified during iteration).
	
	Constructors of ArrayList:
	1. ArrayList()
	   → Creates an ArrayList with a default capacity of 10.
	
	2. ArrayList(int initialCapacity)
	   → Creates an ArrayList with a user-defined capacity.
	
	3. ArrayList(Collection coll)
	   → Creates an ArrayList containing the elements of the specified collection (loose coupling).
